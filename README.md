##Project 1: The impact of interest rate changes and inflationary pressures on sovereign debt dynamics: Portuguese Case Study (Co-Authored with Miguel Oliveira and Tiago Campos)

i) I utilized R and Gretl for the purpose of employing a debt equation specification and a VAR(2) model. This allowed me to both predict and compute the Impulse Response Functions (IRFs) concerning Portuguese debt in relation to key variables, such as: debt interest rate, GDP growth, inflation, and primary surplus.

ii) With both the models, it was demonstrated that the Portuguese debt is sustainable and has a decreasing trajectory in the coming years. Also, with the IRFs, the reaction of debt with respect to various variables was effectively modelled.
